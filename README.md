GBIF NPT Startup
==========
The NPT Startup is intended to enable countries with limited or no web
presence to start a first national biodiversity information site showing GBIF mediated data
relevant for the country. As the NPT Startup is developed in Drupal, it could also provide a
basis for joint developments in Drupal by GBIF Participant Nodes.
With the review, the Secretariat intended to learn more about the extent to which the
NPT Startup in its current form can meet the needs of its target groups, identified as:  
  1. Nodes that are interested in using the NPT Startup
  2. Nodes that wish to serve as an adviser to others in setting up their NPT Startup
  3. Nodes that would like to plan development around the NPT Startup and Drupal.
